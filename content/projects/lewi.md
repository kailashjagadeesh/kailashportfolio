<h2> Key Features </h2>

Obstacle mapping is essential for the robust operation of robotic networks, yet existing approaches struggle with mapping occluded objects. Our project, LEWI (Localization and mapping of Enclosed space using Wi-Fi signals), leverages the unique properties of Wi-Fi signals to map objects that are traditionally challenging to detect.

- Utilizes compressive sensing, a novel algorithm capable of reconstructing signals from incomplete observations, to efficiently map occluded obstacles with minimal data.
- Explores the ability of Wi-Fi signals to pass through and decay through objects, enabling the mapping of obstacles not directly visible to the robot.
- Achieves accurate localization and shape determination of occluded objects within enclosed spaces.
- Designed for scenarios where a group of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) or robots needs to cooperatively build an aerial map within a limited timeframe.
- Addresses the practical constraints of delay-sensitive applications by minimizing the required measurements while still providing comprehensive obstacle mapping.

Our project, driven localization using Wi-Fi signals, pushes the boundaries of obstacle mapping in robotics, offering a solution that is both efficient and effective.
