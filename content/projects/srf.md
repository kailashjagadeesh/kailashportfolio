<h1> Objective</h1>
As a dedicated member of this transformative project, I contributed to the development of Supernumerary Robotic Fingers, a wearable robot designed to enhance the capabilities of the human hand for performing a range of prehensile, bimanual, and manipulation tasks.

<h2> Technology Stack</h2>

- **Machine Learning**
- **Control Systems**
- **Rehabilitative Robotics**
- **Dynamics**

<h2> Key Features</h2>
The wearable robot serves as an active compensatory tool, particularly beneficial in the early stages of therapeutic recovery and rehabilitation. Key features include:

- **Enhanced Grasping Abilities:** Designed to augment hand functions, aiding patients in recovering grasping abilities.
- **Intuitive Control:** Flex sensors on the patient's fingers, integrated into a hand glove, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) enable intuitive control of the two robotic fingers.
- **Therapeutic Recovery:** Facilitates arm use even in the absence of fully recovered hand grasp function.
- **Chronic Hemiparetic Support:** Offers assistance for chronic hemiparetic patients to lead independent and productive lives.
- **Rehabilitation Device:** Intended as a tool to assist in bimanual tasks, such as grasping and manipulating objects.

This project, employing Machine Learning, Control Systems, Rehabilitative Robotics, and Dynamics, represents a significant stride in assistive technology, providing innovative solutions for individuals in therapeutic recovery seeking enhanced hand functionality.
