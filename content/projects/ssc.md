<h2> Key Features</h2>
The sign language-to-speech converter device is designed to enhance communication for individuals with speech disabilities. Key features include:

- **Sign Language Decoding:** Utilizes finger movements and angular hand positions for decoding signs into specific words.
- **Custom Voice Set:** Feeds decoded words to a speaker with a custom voice set, improving speech efficiency and accuracy.
- **Personalized Calibration:** The system is tuned and calibrated to an individual's hand and finger movements, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.
- **Input Sensors:** Flex sensors and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) capture and process input signals from sign language gestures.
- **Gesture Tracking:** IMU data is used to predict hand angles, enabling accurate tracking of gestures.
- **Mobile and Unrestrictive:** Battery-powered design ensures mobility and unrestricted use in various communication scenarios.

This project, incorporating Sony sPresence, nRF24L01+ Network, Sensor Fusion, and Deep Learning, represents a significant advancement in assistive technology, offering a streamlined and effective communication tool for individuals with speech disabilities.
