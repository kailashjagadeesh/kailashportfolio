<h1> Objective</h1>
As a member of this project, I contributed to the development of a solution addressing the critical need for efficient railway track maintenance and inspection.

<h2> Tech Stack </h2>

- **Robot Operating System (ROS)** 
- **Gazebo** 
- **MATLAB**
- **NGINX**
- **Tensorflow**
- **Sensors:** MPU 6050, GPS, Laser Scanner(LIDAR)

<h2> Key Features </h2>
Regular maintenance and inspection are vital for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of railway transportation. In India, where manual inspections are the norm, our project introduces an autonomous 4-wheeled robot designed for comprehensive railway track defect detection.

- Capable of performing ultrasonic Nondestructive Test (NDT) for internal crack detection and 3D-laser profiling for surface cracks, gauge length, and ballast profile inspection.
- Equipped with a machine vision system (camera) for anomaly detection in fasters and sleepers.
- Autonomous inspection of tracks for defects in Ballast, Rails, Sleepers, and Fasteners, utilizing various testing methods.
- Integrated GPS, odometer, and IMU sensors for precise robot positioning and status monitoring.
- Inspection data, including ongoing capture and defect details, transmitted to a user-friendly web server.
- Web server accessible by inspection personnel for real-time monitoring and analysis, including live camera feed, laser track profiling, and other inspection data.
- Automated alerts to base stations for detected defects, providing spatio-temporal coordinates and defect details.

The use of ROS Gazebo, MATLAB, NGINX, and Tensorflow in our tech stack allowed us to develop a robust and efficient digital twin for autonomous railway track inspection, reducing human effort and enhancing accuracy.
