<h2> Key Features</h2>
The project focuses on using Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar to detect and estimate vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat frequencies, in wildlife without the need for physical devices. Key features include:

- **Non-Invasive Monitoring:** Utilizes FMCW radar for non-contact measurement of vital signs, eliminating the need for devices worn by animals.
- **Wide Field Coverage:** Offers a broader field for tracking both animal and human movements, crucial for preventing poaching and hunting in wildlife sanctuaries.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Provides real-time tracking of vital signs through radar technology, enhancing monitoring capabilities.
- **Weather-Resilient:** Works in all weather conditions, eliminating constraints faced by some existing models.
- **Hardware Utilization:** Texas Instruments IWR6843AOPEVM hardware is employed, leveraging its capabilities in mm waves and Fourier transformations.
- **Simulations and Applications:** MATLAB is used for simulations of heartbeat and respiration rates, and the project explores applications in motion tracking, contour detection, and area scanning.

The project marks a significant advancement in wildlife monitoring, offering a more effective and non-intrusive solution for preserving and protecting animal species in their natural habitats.
